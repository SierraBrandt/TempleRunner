"Lost under the great pyramids, a lone explorer must find all of the diamonds to escape the dark maze. Don't find the diamonds within the time limit? You lose. But be careful of the dungeon monsters, who will try and slow you down..."

"This game will be a maze game where the player needs to find all the diamonds by walking around. There will be mobs in which the player must kill to advance and find the diamonds. If the player is hit by the mob, the player losings a heart (3 total) when the player loses all 3 hearts, the game is over. Another way to lose the game is if the timer runs out of time (30-60 seconds depending on the complexity of the maze, amount of diamonds and amount of mobs). To win, the player must find & collect all of the diamonds."
